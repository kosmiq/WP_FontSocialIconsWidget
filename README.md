This project is a widget for Wordpress to add links to social medias.

Most of the widgets available these days base the icons on png's or other image types.
This will use Zurbs awesome Foundation Icons instead (http://www.zurb.com/playground/foundation-icons) licensed under the MIT-license. All credit to them for this great set.

The PHP-code is somewhat based on previous work by Nathan Rice for Studiopress and their Simple Social Icons plugin/widget.

Feel free to base any work you perform on this.
